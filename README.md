This repository contains the implementation of a new version U-Net (DC-UNet) used to segment different types of biomedical images. This is a binary classification task: the neural network predicts if each pixel in the biomedical images is either a region of interests (ROI) or not. The neural network structure is described in this [**paper**] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00414).
